Hyperbolic neural network layers.

This module contains implementations of various neural network layers
that operate in hyperbolic space, including:
- Linear layers (fully connected)
- Convolutional layers (1D and 2D)
- Transformer layers (self-attention, transformer blocks)
- Activation functions
